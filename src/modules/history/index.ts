/**
 * HistoryModule — read-only access to an agent's full uncompressed message
 * history, backed by context-manager's native chronicle secondary index
 * (`queryMessagesByTime` / `queryMessagesByChannel` /
 * `queryMessagesByTimeAndChannel` / `getChannelMessageCounts` /
 * `getChannelTokenStats`, @animalabs/context-manager >= 0.6.0). Those calls
 * are O(log n + k) against chronicle's `/timestamp` and
 * `/metadata/external/channelId` field indexes, not a full-store scan, so
 * this module can answer "what happened in #foo last Tuesday" against a
 * multi-million-message store without walking the whole log.
 *
 * Four tools:
 *  - `stats`    — per-channel message counts (all-time) + token totals
 *                 (range-scoped), for orienting before pulling raw content.
 *  - `extract`  — paginated raw messages for a time range and/or channel.
 *  - `search`   — substring/regex match over a narrowed candidate window,
 *                 with an explicit truncation signal when the caller's
 *                 filter was too broad for `maxScan`.
 *  - `overview` — a compression-summary table of contents (zero new LLM
 *                 calls) for a time range, gap-filled with raw message
 *                 counts wherever nothing has been summarized yet. See
 *                 `handleOverview` for the fold-reduction and gap-fill
 *                 algorithm.
 *
 * All four accept `channelId` as either a channel label (e.g. `#general`)
 * or a raw internal channel id — `resolveChannel()` resolves a label via
 * the bound `ChannelRegistry`'s durable label history before it reaches any
 * context-manager call. A host that hasn't wired up MCPL (no registry
 * bound) sees unchanged behavior: `channelId` is treated as already the raw
 * internal id.
 *
 * Kept deliberately read-only, same posture as HealthModule: no side
 * effects, no message mutation. `onProcess` is a no-op.
 *
 * Every query dispatch collapses onto `queryMessagesByTimeAndChannel` — its
 * own implementation already handles "only a time range", "only a channel",
 * or "neither" by delegating to the single-filter native queries (see
 * context-manager's `test/message-store-history-index.test.ts`), so this
 * module doesn't need to re-decide which of the three query methods to call.
