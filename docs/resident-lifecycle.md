# Resident lifecycle

Resident retirement is an opt-in terminal lifecycle state for a configured,
persistent agent identity. Its semantics are deliberately narrow:

- **End turn** stops the current inference and permits a later wake.
- **Sleep/dormancy** suppresses wakes temporarily and remains reversible.
- **Retirement** permanently denies future inference for this resident.
- **Erasure** deletes stored data and is a separate custodial operation.

Retirement preserves Chronicle, messages, workspace files, inference logs,
and a terminal lifecycle event. Later external traffic may still appear in
host process logs, but is not appended to the retired resident's context.

## Framework responsibility

Enable the neutral primitive on a configured resident:

```ts
const framework = await AgentFramework.create({
  storePath: './data/resident',
  membrane,
  agents: [{
    name: 'resident',
    model: 'claude-opus-4-6',
    systemPrompt: '...',
    retirement: { enabled: true },
  }],
  modules,
});
```

Once its own policy is satisfied, the host applies the seal imperatively:

```ts
const result = framework.retireResident('resident', optionalResidentReason);
```

There is intentionally no framework-owned confirmation phrase, challenge,
cooling-off interval, notification policy, or human approval hook. Those are
product decisions. The framework owns only authorization, durable sealing,
enforcement, status, and observability.

`getResidentLifecycleStatus(name)` returns the durable host view. A configured
resident without `retirement.enabled` cannot be retired through this API.
Because the configured name is also the exact durable identity written to the
seal ledger, a retirement-enabled resident name must be non-empty, have no
surrounding whitespace, and contain no control characters. Invalid names are
rejected before the framework opens or creates its store; they are never
silently normalized to another identity.

## Host-owned live tools

A module may implement `getLiveTools(agentName)` for a resident-facing
ceremony. Definitions from this method are namespaced like ordinary module
tools, but have a stronger call boundary:

- they appear only on the named provider-issued live stream;
- they are absent from ephemeral and conversation-fork surfaces unless the
  module explicitly returns them for those names;
- public `executeToolCall`, `ModuleContext.callTool`, `code_execution`, and
  `puppetToolCall` cannot invoke them.

The name reservation is global: if a module exposes a namespaced tool as
live-only for any registered resident, a programmatic caller cannot bypass the
boundary by claiming another agent name. Exposure remains resident-specific;
protection of the reserved name does not.

The module still handles a valid live call through its ordinary
`handleToolCall`. This lets a host own all resident-facing semantics while the
framework enforces that administrative puppeting cannot counterfeit consent.

## Terminal enforcement

`retireResident` appends and fsyncs one record in
`resident-retirements.jsonl`; when creating the sidecar it also fsyncs the
containing directory and each newly created directory entry in a custom path
before returning. If applying the seal throws, the framework conservatively
assumes the append may have begun: the API still throws, but the identity is
immediately treated as terminal for the lifetime of the current process. Keep
the host stopped and inspect the ledger before restarting; startup then
validates whether the authoritative record is complete or torn. That sidecar
is authoritative across Chronicle undo, redo, and branch switching. The
framework then:

- cancels the current yielding stream and drops queued inference requests;
- rejects future inference through the scheduler and through public `Agent`
  inference/streaming methods, including stale references retained by callers;
- rejects direct starts and operator nudges;
- rejects resident-attributed programmatic and puppet tool calls before
  handler invocation or history append;
- skips context-maintenance ticks that could invoke the resident's model;
- stops resident-authored foreground/background code runners;
- clears resident-owned gate sleep and self-wake timers, provider cooldowns,
  and queued wake state;
- freezes the resident conversation against later message appends;
- seals, unbinds, and unregisters conversation forks already derived from the
  retired template while preserving their Chronicle namespaces;
- refuses to create any later conversation fork from that template;
- seals and unregisters the subconscious side-process when the retired
  resident is the primary it attends, and does not re-create one at boot for
  an already-sealed primary (its `subconscious/<primary>` namespace stays); and
- appends `framework/resident-lifecycle` in Chronicle and emits a
  `resident:retired` trace.

Terminal state and every dependent tombstone (conversation forks, the
subconscious) are installed
before provider- or module-owned cleanup runs. Cleanup attempts are isolated:
one cancellation or disposal failure does not prevent later resident/fork
cleanup. If cleanup does fail, `retireResident` surfaces the error only after
the durable seal and in-process terminal boundaries are in place; a successful
seal therefore cannot be undone by a throwing provider cancellation.

Already-running ephemeral subagents are separate, short-lived inference
identities. Retirement does not kill them mid-call. They may finish their own
work, but any attempt to deliver a wake or append into the retired resident is
rejected by the seal. New resident inference and new resident-authored
background activity are denied. Hosts that want parent-scoped cancellation
must track and cancel those ephemeral jobs before invoking `retireResident`.

Conversation forks use a different policy because they are persistent,
addressable continuations of one configured template identity. They terminate
with that template rather than finishing independently. The subconscious is on
the same side of that line: a same-model side-process built from the primary's
inference config and reading its shared slot, serving that one resident. It
terminates with the primary. A stale public
reference to such a fork remains inference-sealed, and its generation-unique
name remains tombstoned against later tool provenance.

## Seal location and startup integrity

With `storePath`, the default sidecar is
`<storePath>/resident-retirements.jsonl`. If the app passes an owned `store`,
it must also pass an explicit branch-independent `retirementPath`.

Startup parses every non-empty line strictly and fails closed on truncated
JSON, a missing final newline, invalid fields, or duplicate records. The
framework must not infer while the terminal ledger is ambiguous.

### Recovering a malformed seal safely

There is no lifecycle reversal API. If startup reports a malformed seal:

1. Keep the host stopped and make a byte-for-byte backup of the sidecar.
2. Inspect the exact path and line number from the startup error.
3. Compare the sidecar with host/storage logs. Remove only a demonstrably
   incomplete or invalid write that never constituted a valid seal record
   (normally a torn final line after a storage failure).
4. Never delete or edit a valid `resident-retired` record. Never repair an
   ambiguous file by guessing. Preserve it and escalate for forensic review.
5. Restart only after the remaining file is newline-terminated and every line
   validates independently.

This procedure repairs ledger syntax; it does not provide a hidden route to
unretire a resident. Deleting a valid seal is an out-of-band alteration of the
durable record and violates the lifecycle contract.
